This project analyzes historical financial data to explore how profit, sales, and cost of goods sold (COGS) are affected by different discount bands and time periods. Tools used include Pandas, SQLite, and Plotly Express for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

Key Analytical Insights

    Identified clear profit differences across discount bands, showing that higher discounts often reduced average profit per product.

    Revealed temporal trends, highlighting how product performance varied across distinct quarters.

    Compared product-level profitability and detected top-performing items in each discount scenario.

    Demonstrated the negative correlation between deeper discounting and profit margins over time.

Conclusions
    The dataset was analyzed over two distinct time periods: November 2013 – February 2014 and July 2014 – October 2014, focusing on the impact of discount bands on profit, 
    sales, and cost of goods sold (COGS).

    Profit Analysis:

        In Nov 2013 – Feb 2014, the highest average profit was generated by products under the "None" discount band, with top performers being Amarilla and VTT.

        In Jul 2014 – Oct 2014, the highest profit shifted to products under the "Low" discount band. While Amarilla and VTT still led, the profit was more evenly distributed among other products within the same discount category, contributing to an overall increase.

    Sales Analysis:

        During the first period, "High" and "None" discount bands led to the highest sales volumes.

        In the second period, "Low" discount products dominated sales, aligning with their higher profitability.

    COGS Analysis:

        In Nov 2013 – Feb 2014, the highest COGS was observed for products under "High" and "None" discounts, with "High" being the most significant contributor.

        In Jul 2014 – Oct 2014, "Low" discount products registered the highest COGS — a direct reflection of their increased sales and profitability.

These patterns suggest a shift in pricing and customer behavior, where moderate discounts ("Low") in the second period became more effective in driving both sales and profit, 
particularly for previously top-performing products.
